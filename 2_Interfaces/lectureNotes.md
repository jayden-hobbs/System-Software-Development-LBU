**Interfaces**
- An `interface` within the Java language is used to `declare` methods
- They are similar to a class, but the methods often have no implementation
- The methods declared within an interface are later `implemented` by one of more classes
- Use of interfaces is an alternative to class based inheritance, and allows looser coupling of implementation code
- Using interfaces allows programmers to agree on a 'contract' in terms of what methods must be provided by a class

**Simple Example**

- The keyword `interface` exists directly in the Java language
- An interface typically appears within its own file in the same way as a class
- See `example.java` for the example code
